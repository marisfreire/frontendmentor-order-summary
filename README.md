## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot about using SVG files as background images which I used to struggle doing, I also got to play around more with fonts and making them more responsive.


### Continued development

I'm still not quite sure about what to do about accessibility when it comes to images being set as background-images, if there's no HTML tag, how can I add an alt attribute or something similar? I plan to start on projects that require Javascript soon as I need to put my skills to the test, even if it'll be quite more challenging.



### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Really taught me everything I know about responsive websites and helped me on this with his videos about font sizes and padding.
